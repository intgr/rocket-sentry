`rocket-sentry` is a simple add-on for the **Rocket** web framework to simplify
integration with the **Sentry** application monitoring system.

Or maybe...

Features
--------

Currently `rocket-sentry` includes two integrations:

* **Rust panic handler:** when a panic happens, it is reported as a Sentry event.
* **Performance Monitoring:** HTTP requests are reported as [Transactions](https://docs.sentry.io/product/performance/transaction-summary/),
  if the `sentry_traces_sample_rate` setting is configured.

  Transactions currently include the following fields:
  - [X] HTTP method
  - [X] GET query string
  - [X] headers
  - [ ] POST data
  - [ ] cookies
  - [ ] environment
  - [ ] URL

Pull requests welcome!

Usage
-----

`rocket-sentry` can be configured via `Rocket.toml` (`sentry_dsn=`) or
environment variable `ROCKET_SENTRY_DSN`.

To use this, add the dependency to your `Cargo.toml`, and add the fairing
to your code:

```rust
use rocket_sentry::RocketSentry;

#[launch]
fn rocket() -> _ {
    rocket::build()
        .attach(RocketSentry::fairing())
        // ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^   add this line
}
```

Then, the Sentry integration can be enabled by adding a `sentry_dsn=` value to
the `Rocket.toml` file, for example:

```toml
[debug]
sentry_dsn = ""  # Disabled
[release]
sentry_dsn = "https://057006d7dfe5fff0fbed461cfca5f757@sentry.io/1111111"
sentry_traces_sample_rate = 0.2  # 20% of requests will be logged under the performance tab
```

Testing
-------

The functionality can be tested with the `examples/panic.rs` example. Just
change the `Rocket.toml` file and run it...

```shell script
cargo run --example panic
```

Then try accessing this URL:
http://localhost:8012/panic?msg=Is+it+time+to+panic+yet?
